# About me

I am a web developer from Hungary, I have been working with [Drupal](http://drupal.org) since 2008. After participating in [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc) in 2011, I joined [Wunderkraut](http://wunderkraut.com) Sweden (formerly known as NodeOne). After spending nearly one wonderful year in Gothenburg I moved back to Budapest to continue working remotely with my fantastic team.

I mainly focus on architecture and backend coding, but I also enjoy diving into the browser's script debugger sometimes. I like simple solutions. I'm interested in learning more and more about agile software development.

Minimalism amazes me, and I am constantly trying to achieve a minimalist lifestyle and mindset. I play squash at amateur level.
