# About me

My name is Bálint Kléri. I am a web developer from Hungary, I have been working with Drupal since 2007. Even though I love my country, I took the challenge and relocated to Sweden in 2011 when NodeOne, the biggest Scandinavian Drupal shop hired me after I participated in Google Summer of Code. I came to Gothenburg, and started as a happy member of a development team called Glenn.

I focus on architecture and backend coding, but I also enjoy diving into the browser's script debugger. Being involved in usability questions also makes me happy, and I like to talk to clients to become more engaged with their needs.

Minimalism amazes me, and I am constantly trying to achieve a minimalist lifestyle and mindset. I play squash at amateur level, and started running lately. Trance is my choice of music.
